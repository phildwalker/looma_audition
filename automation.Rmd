This is where we talk about how we would automate a process like this...

presenting a few different considerations..

what if we are working on personal windows machines?

what if we are working on a centralized linux server?

what if the data come in batches?

what if the data needs to be cleaned/ validated before we would push it out?

what if the data came in a consistent manner and we just wanted to run the analysis so it was "ready in the morning"
