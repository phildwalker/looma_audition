# Prompt

Imagine we ran an experiment to test the impact a Loop™ campaign has on sales. The experiment involved 42 stores in 3 groups:  

* “Program test”: These stores had the full Loop™ campaign as it would normally run, with a display of featured products and a tablet showing 2-3 films in a looping playlist  
* “Film control” These stores had the full program but with the film from one brand (“Brewery A”) left out.   
* “Baseline control” These stores did not have Loop™ campaigns or featured products on display.  


Assume you need to provide an analysis of this experiment under time constraints (in reality, we expect you to devote 2-4 hours to this audition project).
